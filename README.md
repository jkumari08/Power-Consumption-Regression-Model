# Power-Consumption-Regression-Model
This project develops a machine learning model to predict power consumption based on temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis identified patterns and insights. It employs Python, using NumPy for computations, Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib for visualizations to optimize power usage predictions.
